This repo will (with time) contain a variety of write-ups about topics in Swift, as far as I understand them.  I am not an expert, but I hope to provide something of value.

About half of them work through methods for using Frameworks in projects.

* useC
* useC2 

talk about C code, naturally, and fairly old methods.  

* Frameworks
* Playground+FW

talk about modern usage and about how to use a Framework (or other Swift code) with a Playground.

* BinaryData
* CommonCrypto

retro-fit older code to Swift3 on topics related to binary data and encryption.

* Swift protocols
* Swift collections
