MainMenu.xib has no window

MainWindowController.xib is not a custom Class
TextWindowController.xib   "              "

Start by making a new Xcode project:
macOS Cocoa Application
no tests

Copy AppDelegate code (comment out TextWindow)

Hillegass:

Construct MainWindowController.xib
Select Sudokublocks3 folder
File -> New -> File OS X Source Cocoa Class
MainWindowController
subclass of NSWindowController, create XIB file, Swift

Place in the window a custom view:  don't set the class yet.

Add new Cocoa class MyView: NSView

set to MyView class in the XIB file

let backgroundColor = NSColor.whiteColor()
backgroundColor.set()
NSBezierPath.fillRect(bounds)

gives an error b/c colors have changed

let backgroundColor = NSColor.white
backgroundColor.set()
NSBezierPath.fill(bounds)

need to connect AppDelegate to the window
most steps from Hillegass were good
this was not:
let mainWindowController = MainWindowController(windowNibName: "MainWindowController")

part in parentheses was missing!
now it gives me the green view

still have an error for no instance variable for the window.
uncomment the IBOutlet part for now

set the size of MyView to 620 x 620
the window is 900 x 675
set it back to white background

add code to MyView

add to Project:
Plotter.swift
PlotUtilities.swift

lots of errors...

Trying to load and draw a puzzle.
Comment out all UI stuff, Hints, etc.
Fixed 50 or so errors, and finally got it to draw the dividers, 
then a first puzzle.

Save this as .v1

Now add the rest of the files and fix all those errors as well.
Comment out UI if necessary.

Then, start hooking up buttons etc.
